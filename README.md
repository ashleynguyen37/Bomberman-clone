# üéÆ shezzor's JavaScript Game Development Template

A small template to create web/browser based games using the HTML canvas element.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What this is

A boilerplate code template along with a few utility functions to jump start your
javascript game devlopment. It includes...

- A standard folder scaffolding and code structure.
- A canvas element and its context already configured and set up for you.
- The main game loop
- Initial control handlers for both keyboard and gamepad.
- A small set of handy utility functions to help with some of the basics.
- A set of TypeScript types for a number of
- A quick example on how to use the code.

## ‚ùå What this isn't

A framework. You'll still need to understand how the canvas element and web works. Which
honestly can only be a good thing. You'll be learning the browser and its features rather
than someone elses interpreation of it.

## üî∞ Getting started

Simply clone the repo and open the resulting code in your favourite editor.

By default, this repo uses native ES modules so you'll need to host the files on a
development server. Or preferably, if you use VSCode like myself, you can use one of the
very handy "Live Server" extensions available which does this all for you.

Alternatively, you can bake in your own build pipeline but that is out of scope of this
repo.

This repo also includes npm dependencies and a set of types to help with TypeScript
development but this is not required or configured by default. Although, I'll be looking
how I can automatically configure this in the future.

## üí• Example code

Included is a small example of how to move an image around the screen using the code
supplied.

`index.js` = Is the main entry point for the example. This calls the `start` function
on our main loop class...

`TemplateDemo.js` = Is the main loop class. This sets up the canvas and initial scene
using the base `Game` class. Speaking of which...

`TestScene.js` = Is the main scene for the included example. This houses all the logic
and drawing routines for each "frame" of the game.

`Logo.js` = An example of an "entity" using the `Entity` class.
